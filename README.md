This is under construction. I am backing up my personal website (abbyruminas.com (https://ahardin7.pythonanywhere.com/) > https://ahardin7.github.io)

I bought a domain name (abbyruminas.com) but python anywhere doesn't allow me to host my content w/o using their designated name. I just did a HTTP redirect for my domain name to the ahardin7 site. I am in the process of moving away from python anywhere and cleaning up my code.
